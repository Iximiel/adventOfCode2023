# My take on the Advent of Code 2023

This is my try to partecipate at the advent of code 2023.

I can define myself a C++ dev, (sometimes I also do some Python), so I am using Ocaml :smile:
:camel:

Let's see if I can learn something

Day 1 is on my other PC (I decided later to set up a git repo), I'll add it hera as soon I go back home

While doing day3 I'm starting to think that I am using a bit too much regex.
